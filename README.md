## Project

A simple drawing tool built with react utilizing the React-Canvas-Draw (https://github.com/embiem/react-canvas-draw). component.<br>

The project allows you to change colours to draw with, and tracks the amount of clicks on the canvas.<br>

Session reliant functionality, such as 'Save' and 'Undo' are yet to be implemented.<br>

The project requires 'React-Canvas-Draw' to be installed.
